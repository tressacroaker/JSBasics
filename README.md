##JavaScript Basics

##Purpose
The purpose of this day project is to familiarize yourself with the basic manipulation methods for both arrays and objects. You will also practice creating variables and functions using logic and the content provided during class.

##Directions
Fork and clone this repository. Complete all of the exercises in the basics.js file. When you have finished, push your code into GitHub.

##Testing

To run the tests you must install mocha, a testing program, and use npm to install dependencies. In your terminal cd to the project directory. Then do the following.

```
npm init
npm install
```
and when that is finished
```
npm install -g mocha
```
OR
```
sudo npm install -g mocha
```
now you can run the tests by typing
```
mocha
```
in the project directory. If you have correctly completed each of the exercises, they will pop up as green with a checkmark. Otherwise, you will have red x's.
